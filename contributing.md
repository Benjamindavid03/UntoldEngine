## Contributing to Untold Engine

Hey indie devs, 

Thanks for your interest to contribute to the Untold Engine.

Since this project has barely been released as an open-source, I am not taking Pull-Request yet. I want to complete the documentation and write more tutorials before allowing Pull-Request.

If you want to help out, I would appreciate if you could report back any bugs you encounter. Make sure to report them at our [Github issues](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine/issues), so we all have access to them.

Thank you.

Once I feel that the documentation is ready, I will allow Pull-Request.
