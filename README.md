# Untold Engine

## Introduction

**The Untold Engine: An easy to use, open source, 3D game engine for iOS/macOS game development**

Hi, my name is [Harold Serrano](http://www.haroldserrano.com), and I developed the **Untold Engine**, an open source 3D game engine written in C++ and Metal Graphics (API).

It took me over five years to develop the *Untold Engine* from scratch. I spent thousands and thousands of hours developing the Untold Engine, and now I'm releasing it as an open source.
